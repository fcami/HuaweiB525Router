    Experimental implementation to properly set upload and download bands.
    What works:
    * The B715s (or at least my sample) does not take into account the SnR (sinr) of the band
      to choose the upload band. As a result, in my case it uses the B3/1800MHz which is noisier than the B28/700MHz.
      This tool will detect this situation and force the right setting.
      NB: It sometimes takes multiple API calls to do so. Other tools behave similarly.
    FixMe:
    * get_download_bands() is not implemented so only the upload band is checked for correctness.
    * if the bands are set to an invalid frequency (2100MHz / B1 for instance), the only way out for now is to use the WebUI to switch the LTE band list to Auto.
      See https://github.com/fcami/HuaweiB525Router/blob/mine/README.md on how to implement this.
